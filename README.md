# üîç Keyword Search Tool for Script Files

This Python script is a lightweight and helpful tool designed to search for specific **keywords or phrases** in script files within a specified folder. It helps you rediscover useful code snippets, notes, or documentation buried in `.sql`, `.py`, `.txt`, or `.ps1` files.

## üß† Why I Built This

As a Data Analyst, I find that this tool helps me foster a good practice of documenting my code while also emphasizing the importance of writing clean and maintainable code, whether that be in an ad hoc SQL Query or a Python data validation script. 

It's not always about reinventing the wheel, but rather about making a useful one that can be used in multiple projects. 

I think that this is a good practice to have in any field, and as someone who benefits from open source code, I think it is important to give back to the community even in such a small way.

## üõ† How to Use

1. **Clone this repo** or copy the script into your environment.
2. Set the `folder_path` variable to the folder you want to search.
3. Set the `keyword` variable to your desired search term.
4. Run the script in any standard Python environment.

```python
# Example
folder_path = r'C:\Users\yourname\Documents\Scripts'
keyword = 'JOIN'
```

## üß© Example Output

```
Keyword found in report_script.sql:
  Line 15: LEFT JOIN vendor_master v on a.id = v.vendor_id
  Line 16: -- Revisit later to optimize vendor join from LEFT to INNER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Or, if nothing is found:
